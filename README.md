# React + Vite

TodoAppMe is a to-do list management application that is customisable and scalable, designed to help users organise and manage their daily tasks efficiently. Our ultimate goal is to develop TodoAppMe into a central, integrated platform capable of managing not only to-do lists, but also other aspects of productivity and personal organisation, such as time management, reminders, notes and much more.
