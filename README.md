# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

TodoAppMe, the TodoList you needed.

TodoAppMe is a to-do list management application that is customisable and scalable, designed to help users organise and manage their daily tasks efficiently. Our ultimate goal is to develop TodoAppMe into a central, integrated platform capable of managing not only to-do lists, but also other aspects of productivity and personal organisation, such as time management, reminders, notes and much more."# TodoAppMe"
